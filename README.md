# Minors-Honors Application

Welcome to the **Minors-Honors Application** repository! This platform streamlines the process for students enrolling in minors and honors courses, allowing for efficient course management and allocation based on student preferences.

## Features

### 1. Admin: Add Courses
The admin panel provides powerful tools for managing minors and honors courses across terms.
- Admins can **add**, **update**, and **manage courses** for each term.
- Course details include:
  - Course code
  - Name
  - Description
  - Eligibility criteria
  - And more

### 2. Faculty: Add Students (Branch-wise)
Faculty members can assign students to courses based on their branch.
- This ensures that only **eligible students** from specific branches are allowed to register for relevant minors and honors courses.

### 3. Students: Submit Course Preferences
Students can log in to view and explore available minors and honors courses.
- Each student can submit their **preferences** by ranking the courses they are interested in.
- The application tracks these preferences for later processing.

### 4. Approval and Allocation of Courses
Once the preference submission period ends, an automated allocation system assigns courses to students.
- Allocation is based on **student preferences** and **available seats**.
- Faculty and admins can review and approve the final course allocations.

## Current Status
> **Note**: This project is currently in the **testing phase**. We are continuously improving features and working to ensure the system is robust for handling real-world scenarios.
